# Quantsim - My attempt at understanding quantum computation
This is an implementation of the notation and logic around quantum computation - qubits, quantum logic gates, etc.
There are more than enough of these online, but I want to build my own to learn about the subject, and maybe test my ability to make and simulate some interesting algorithms

## TODO

- [ ] Add visualizations for the circuit and plots for the measurements
- [ ] Look into performance gains for multi-qubit gates
- [ ] Unify the infrastructure to support measurements more cleanly
