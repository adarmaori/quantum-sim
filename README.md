# Quantsim - My attempt at understanding quantum computation
This is an implementation of the notation and logic around quantum computation - qubits, quantum logic gates, etc.
There are more than enough of these online, but I want to build my own to learn about the subject, and maybe test my ability to make and simulate some interesting algorithms
